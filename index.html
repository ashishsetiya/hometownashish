    <h3 class="nanak-txt">Nanakmatta is a historical town named after the Sikh pilgrimage site, Gurdwara Nanakmatta Sahib, in the state of Uttarakhand, India. Sikh tradition records that the site was once called Gorakhmata, a centre of Siddh-jogis named after the founder of their order, Gorakhnath, at the distance of 30 miles from Reetha sahib. In the Siddh-Gost in Guru Granth Sahib, the story of Guru Nanak ji on his first udasi is told, wherein he had a long discourse with siddhas on matters of religion and metaphysics. Tradition says that the place was renamed Nanakmatta to perpetuate the memory of Guru's visit. The town is associated with Guru Nanak Dev and Guru Hargobind.
        It is situated on the bank of Deoha stream, which has since been dammed into a reservoir named Nanak Sagar. The Gurudwara is located 15 kilometres west of Khatima Railway Station on road to Tanakpur. The holy shrine is near the town of Sitarganj. It is one of three Sikh Holy places in the state, with others being Gurdwara Hemkunt Sahib and Gurudwara Reetha Sahib.</h3>
